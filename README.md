My goal with this experiment was to set up a Razor page that was generated from HtmlWebpackPlugin in ASP.NET Core 3.

In other words, I want webpack to generate my controller view (.cshtml file) because it has a better understanding of what the client code should look like. At the same time, I wanted the full power of ASP.NET Core in my Razor files.
